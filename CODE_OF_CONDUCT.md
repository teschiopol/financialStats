# 📚 Rules

How to work well together.

## 🌲 Branch

- Create a branch for each feature

- Test with (future) workflow on develop, before merge on master

## ✍🏻 Commit

- style: for frontend mostly

- feat: only feature

- fix: resolved issued

- chore: internal things

- test: about testing or example
